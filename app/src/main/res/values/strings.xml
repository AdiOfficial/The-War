    <string name="rules_content">\t\tThe deck of cards is divided into two parts, then each player gets one part.
        The first and the second player simultaneously draw one card and compare their values.
        The player with the higher card value picks up the cards and places them underneath his deck.
        If the cards have the same value (e.g.: queen vs. queen), the war is starting.
        During the war, you should uncover one card and place it on your uncovered cards (pattern to the top),
        then draw the next card, put on the covered cards and then they are compared.
        The higher value card wins, and the winner of the war receives all cards used in the war.
        Repeat this step if you can not find a winner again during the war.\n\n
        \t\tThe one who first takes away all the cards from the opponent wins. Collected cards are put into the bottom
        of the deck and can later be used many times, which is why the game can take a very long time.
        However, you can stop it at any time. In this case, the winner is the player with more cards.
